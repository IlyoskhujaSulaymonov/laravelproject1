6. **Admin Navigation**: Added "Na'munaviy savollar" section to admin sidebar

### Key Features
- Separate management interface for sample questions
- Association with subjects instead of topics
- Full CRUD operations
- Mathematical formula rendering with MathJax
- Proper error handling for array/string conversion issues

## 2. Telegram Integration for Plan Purchases

### Overview
Implemented a comprehensive Telegram bot integration system that allows users to request plan purchases through the website, which are then sent to an admin via Telegram. Admins can respond to these requests directly through Telegram.

### Components Created
1. **TelegramService**: Handles communication with the Telegram Bot API
2. **PlanPurchaseRequest Model**: Tracks user requests with status management
3. **Database Migration**: Created plan_purchase_requests table
4. **API Endpoints**: Handle requests from the frontend
5. **Admin Interface**: Web interface for managing requests (index and show views)
6. **Frontend Integration**: Updated landing page and dashboard components
7. **Telegram Controller**: API controller for handling Telegram integration
8. **Factories**: Created factories for testing (PlanFactory, PlanPurchaseRequestFactory)
9. **Tests**: Feature tests for the Telegram integration
10. **Setup Documentation**: Complete setup guide for Telegram integration
11. **Webhook Command**: Command to easily set up Telegram webhook

### Key Features
- Users can request plan purchases through the website
- Requests are sent to admin via Telegram with inline approval/rejection buttons
- Admins can respond directly through Telegram
- Status tracking for all requests (pending, approved, rejected)
- Web interface for admins to manage requests
- Comprehensive error handling and logging
- Security measures to ensure only authorized admins can respond

### Technical Implementation Details

#### Backend
- **Models**: PlanPurchaseRequest with relationships to User and Plan
- **Controllers**: Api/TelegramController for handling requests
- **Services**: TelegramService for bot operations
- **Migrations**: Database structure for tracking requests
- **Routes**: API endpoints for frontend integration

#### Frontend
- **Landing Page**: Updated plan selection to use new API endpoint
- **Dashboard**: Updated plan upgrade functionality to use new API endpoint
- **User Experience**: Clear feedback when requests are submitted

#### Security
- Only configured admin chat ID can respond to requests
- All API endpoints protected with authentication
- Webhook requests validated
- Proper error handling and logging

#### Testing
- Feature tests for all functionality
- Factories for creating test data
- Database assertions for proper data handling

## 3. Bug Fixes

### Mathematical Formula Rendering
Fixed "Array to string conversion" error in Question and Variant models by implementing robust data type handling:

1. **processFormulas() Helper Method**: Handles multiple data formats (string arrays, object arrays, JSON strings, null values)
2. **Type Validation**: Added is_string(), is_array() checks before operations
3. **Exception Handling**: Proper try-catch blocks with fallback mechanisms
4. **Data Processing**: Enhanced handling of mathematical formulas in different formats
